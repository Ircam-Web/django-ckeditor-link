==== 0.2.1 (under development) ===

- go ahead


==== 0.2.0 (released soon) ===

- backward incompatible change: field "page" of CMSFilerLinkBase changed to "cms_page", for when used
  as base for cms plugins, it has possible clashes with the CMSPlugins "page" attribute. When creating migrations,
  django should ask if it was a rename. Pls try with makemigrations --dry-run first!


==== 0.1.6 ===

- provide ckeditor_link.link_model, with default abstract link models, a basic version,
  and a django-cms / django-filer enabled version.
- backward incompatible change (only if you use the built in template tag):
  get_link_style, get_link_target for getting target and style of a link.
- better selenium testing with firefox instead of phantomjs should do on travis CI now!
- dropping django 1.7 support


==== 0.1.5 ===

- support django 1.11
- readme enhanced, for pypi submit a short version only
- new project urls entered
- selenium testing still a mess, still doesnt work on travis CI


==== 0.1.4 ===

- fallback: legacy href values can be migrated into a specified field/attribute


==== 0.1.3 ===

- working more or less


==== 0.0.1 (not yet) ===

- support for django 1.9
- refactored tests, to use default manage.py test command
